# PDF File Location - UPDATED

**Note:** For Vite development server, PDF files should be placed in `/client/public`, not this root `/public` directory.

The Maersk Q2 2025 Interim Report PDF is already correctly located at:
```
client/public/Maersk-Q2-2025-Interim-Report.pdf
```

This `/public` directory is used for production builds only.
